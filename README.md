# üí™ Bicepify

Bicepify is a sample code repository project with a mission to simplify getting started into Azure Bicep.

We aim to do this by creating real example templates that are easy to digest and break down Azure Bicep concepts, with straight to the point explanations to jump start your Bicep journey üöÄ

## üß¨ New to Bicep? Getting started

1. Download [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to your machine

2. Install the [Bicep extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-bicep)

3. To test, deploy (resources to Azure) and debug Bicep files:
    - Install [AzureCLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?tabs=azure-cli) or
    - [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell?view=azps-10.3.0) (must install [Bicep manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install#install-manually) if you want to use with PowerShell)

4. [Fork](https://github.com/riosengineer/Bicepify/fork) this repository so you have a copy to lab with our examples

5. In your forked repository, click the green Code and Open with VisualStudio for a quick start

## üß™ About the project

There's lots of great blog articles, Microsoft Documentation and repositories out there for Bicep.

However, the data is scattered and sometimes the official documentation will have minimal examples or lack some context where real world examples can benefit the community to grasp the concept in a more relatable way.

This is where we hope to bridge the gap for new Bicep users getting started, or those trying to elevate their Infrastructure as Code to a new level using some fantastic concepts Bicep has to offer.

Using simple templated examples, with test data, the examples in this repository we hope will enable others to learn and benefit from.

Within the `bicep-examples` or `bicep-cicd-examples` folders you will find categorised concept folders that further contain example `.bicep` templates and their supporting documentation & files.

These will showcase a particular Bicep concept with a corresponding README file to give an explanation of what the example is, and how it can benefit.

Where possible, examples will be complimented by a blog post giving a deeper dive.
