# Azure Bicep - Iterative loops (for)

## Introduction

For loops in Azure Bicep can be a great way to simplify and minimise your Bicep templates, as they allow you to define multiple copies of a resource which helps reduce and avoids us repeating code in our Bicep templates. 

Using a for loop, you can quickly deploy multiple resources, in this instance a virtual network resource with multiple subnets in one block. 

You can go through the Microsoft Learn training module for this which is great [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/build-flexible-bicep-templates-conditions-loops/).

## ðŸ“ƒ Benefits of using for loops in Bicep

1. âœ… DRY (Don't repeat yourself) - avoids repeating Bicep code unnecessarily

2. âœ… Clean templates. By avoiding duplicating code, we can reduce large template files with lots of code lines

3. âœ… Best practice. It's good practice to use for loops in your Bicep templates for the reasons above as well as maintainability as you scale

## For Loop Example

In the basic example within the `main.bicep` file, we can using the `for` property to state for each `vnet` resource, loop through and create the virtual network with subnets.

As the variable (refer to the `main.bicep` file) also contains the required subnets, we're further looping the sub-property within the `vnet` to loop for each `subnet` within the `vnet` as it deploys.

```javascript
resource vnet 'Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks@2020-06-01' = [for vnet in vnets: {
  name: vnet.name
  location: location
  properties: {
    addressSpace: {
      addressPrefixes: [
        vnet.addressPrefix
      ]
    }
    subnets: [for subnet in vnet.subnets: {
      name: subnet.name
      properties: {
        addressPrefix: subnet.subnetPrefix
      }
    }]
  }
}]
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

> [!NOTE]  
> You need to have a resource group deployed before trying this out.

In VisualStudio Code open a terminal and run:

CLI

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription 'subscription name or id'
az deployment group create -g 'your-rg' --confirm-with-what-if -f '.\main.bicep'
```

or PowerShell

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -Subscription "subscription name or id"
New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -Confirm -ResourceGroup "your-rg -TemplateFile "main.bicep"
```
