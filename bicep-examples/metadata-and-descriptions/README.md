# Azure Bicep - Metadata & Descriptions

## Introduction

Whether you're starting your Azure Bicep journey and want to align to best practice methods straight from the get go, or you have existing templates that could do with a freshen up - descriptions and metadata has a place in your Azure Bicep templates.

## ðŸ“ƒ Benefits of using metadata and descriptions in your Azure Bicep files

1. âœ… Reusability. By defining the `@description` for the parameters other engineers can quickly understand the template and what function each parameter and variable is

2. âœ… Accountability. By defining the `metadata =` information we're able to define the Azure Bicep name, description and business/team ownership for maintain the module (if applicable. Otherwise this is good just to describe the modules purpose)

3. âœ… Best practice. It's good practice to have metadata and descriptions in your Azure Bicep files. It offers a consistent experience for everyone, and incorporates the above benefits that align into the best practice model

> [!TIP]
> You can hover over parameters in your .bicepparam file to get the parameter description information.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

> [!NOTE]  
> Metadata and descriptions decorators are just for the Azure Bicep file and have no bearing on deployment resources, however, as with all the examples there is a real world example deployment to accommodate the concept to bring the picture full circle.

In VisualStudio Code open a terminal and run:

CLI

```bash
az login
az account set --subscription 'subscription name or id'
az deployment sub create --confirm-with-what-if -l 'uksouth' -f .\metadata-example.bicep -p .\metadata-example.bicepparam
```

or PowerShell

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
Set-AzContext -Subscription "subscription name or id"
New-AzDeployment -Confirm -Location "UKSouth" -TemplateFile ".\metadata-example.bicep" -TemplateParameterFile ".\metadata-example.bicepparam"
```
